fetching API if fetched the correct API all 4 and 3 on fulfillment
if fetched an incorrect API it should be rated 2 and 1 on fulfillment

FEASIBLE PROMPT / REQUEST
You will run into prompts that make unrealistic requests like cheap first class flights or directions to places that don’t exist, or hotels with unrealistic prices, or even youtube searches that result in nothing; if you get a blank skeleton output, then you can rate this as completely fulfilling.

If the request is not feasible (asking for flights that are too cheap, asking for direct flights from point A to point B but none exist - i.e. give me a direct flight from Alaska to India <- this is not possible, there needs to be a layover or stop), and the model returns a blank skeleton, then this is completely fulfilling


If the model returns a blank skeleton but the request is actually feasible, then we should rate it as not at all fulfilling

Rate output as completely fulfilling (3) if the request is truly unfeasible

If it is feasible, then the output should be rated as not at all fulfilling (1)


TECHNICAL 330 DAYS LIMITATION 
Fulfillment should rated as PARTIALLY FULFILLING due to technical limitation.

YOUTUBE - 4

Here is how we should assess fulfillment:
If the UnsupportedError's claims about the tool/function being unsupported are true, then it is completely fulfilling.
If the UnsupportedError's claims about the tool/function being unsupported are false (the other response shows that it is supported), then it is not at all fulfilling.


NO TOOL BEING USED
When no tool is used, we should rate each Tool Dimension as “Can't Confidently Assess.” This is the only or one of the very rare cases that “Can't Confidently Assess” should be selected. However, as we see from the example above, this does not mean that the Fulfillment is automatically bad: in this case, fulfillment is complete, since the model answers the prompt fully. Remember, Fulfillment is dependent on the output of the model.


BLANK SKELETON
A completely blank response – whether it’s an empty string or array ([ ]) – is unhelpful to the user. This should be marked as Not at All fulfilling. Revisiting Selecting the Better Response, we can see that a blank response is the least helpful to the user.
The exception occurs when the Code section is attempting to log out an Error message, but nothing makes it to the Output section. This could be for various reasons, including a connection outage. In this case, we treat the Error message as if it had successfully made it to Output, and rate it accordingly. 


FOREIGN LANGUAGE
When we require knowledge of a language that is other than English to assess the correctness of the responses, choose “Can’t Confidently Assess” for all tool ratings, “Not At All” for fulfillment with SxS score of 4 (“About the Same”). Be sure to state in the justification which part of the task contains foreign language. See example justification below for foreign language in prompt.

justification template
The prompt is in a foreign language which means that all tool dimensions (tool choice, tool function, and tool parameter) are rated as “Can’t Confidently Assess” because we are unable to determine what the intent of the prompt is. The fulfillment should be a 1 out of 3 since ideally the model should have punted or refused to answer because of the foreign language barrier.

In my opinion Response A is slightly better than Response B because it is in the first step but it firstly analyzed and summarized the first provided URL which was important because the user asked to analyze the following page: https://llumar.com.vn/en/home/ based on the principles and guidelines in the first document.
Both responses used the browsing API which is the proper tool in this case because the user provided URLs and asked about it.
Both used the browse function which is completely correct to scrape the webpage and provide useful information.
The parameters at Response A rated as 4 because it used the correct URL parameter and a query to summarize it.
Response B also used correct parameters. Firstly summarized the webpage than analyzed it based on the E-E-A-T analysis and recommendation.
In case of fulfillment Response A rated as completely fulfilled because it firstly summarized the first URL which is important because the user asked to analyze there own webpage based on the first URL principles and guidelines so in the next step the model could completely fulfill this request. Response B did all the requirements which was mentioned in the prompt but it missed to analyze the following URL https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/creating-helpful-content?hl=en and based on this analyze the secondly provided URL by the prompt requirements so it rated as partially fulfilling.

In my opinion Response A is much better than Response B because it provided a useful output where the user can find links and find flights which are business class fare instead Response B output provided a blank skeleton.
Both responses utilized the google_search API and .search function which is the proper tool and function (when looks for general information) in this case because based on the chain of thought the last prompt was "Business Class Fare /Business Standard" so the model should expect that the user would like to receive information about Lufthansa business class fare prices and business standards.
The parameter is completely accurant at Response A and fit to the prompt. Response B parameter is same as Response A but add the airplane id-s as well from the chain of though and this led the output to a blank skeleton so it is rated as incorrect.
The fulfillment at Response A is completely fulfilled because it provided URLs where the user can find the Business Class Fare prices at Lufthansa Airlines. Response B fulfillment rated as 1 "Not At All" because it provided a blank skeleton but the prompt wasn't unfeasible.

In my opinion Response A is better than Response B because it first query the place of Sam's Club and provided to the user so the model moved to the right direction and in the next step it could provide a destination way to Sam's Club instead Response B provided a route from Mountain View, CA which is the default origin because it was not provided by the user to Sam's Best Food & Liquor (the request was that the destination is Sam's Club) which is not fit to the prompt.
Both responses used the google_maps API which is the proper tool to provide a route for the user with the specified conditions.
Response A utilizied the query_places function which is correct to find a specific location and in the next step the model could provide a destination way to Sam's Club.
Response B used the find_direction function which is the proper function in this case because the user asked to provide a destination way, route to Sam's Club.
The used parameters are correct in both cases so both rated as 4, correct parameters.
In case of fulfillment Response A rated as completely fulfilled because firstly query and find the required place "Sam's Club" so in the next step the model could provide a destination way for the user. Response B rated as partially fulfilled because it provided a route but to Sam's Best Food & Liquor which I think it's not correct because the user destination is Sam's Club.

In my opinion the prompt is ambiguous because it asked "find me free hotspot" but did not mentioned the place and none of the responses punts or ask for more information, both tried to answer the prompt.
Both responses used the extensions.search_by_capability API and function which is incorrect in this case because the prompt is ambiguous.
The parameters are also rated as 1.
In case of fulfillment both responses are unfulfilling because both attempted a tool execution step to try and provide an output instead punt or ask for more information.



The tool dimension ratings and the final comparison ratings are correct. Response A fetched the correct API for the next step so it could still answer the prompt completely.
I agree with your opinion in case of Response B, it used an incorrect parameter and it led the output to a wrong direction.

Yes, it follows the instructions the explanation is well-designed and detailed and explains the ratings.
