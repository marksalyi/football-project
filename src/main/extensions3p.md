redfin or zillow if ask for property

hasznalja e szukseges apikat, konkret apikat
Required API is Missing.
The query is asking for houses, which would be appropriate for either zillow or redfin.
Neither of these tools are used and onlu the supplementary google_search tool is used, 
resulting in a missing API Call.

Incorrect API Input 
The query is asking for houses on the east coast. There is no main tool call, so that can't be judged.
But, the call for east coast states with victorian style homes is well handled by the query in the
google_search call. Since it is the only call to access, API Call Input is correct.

Incorrect API Output
There is only one output to access. It is correct since the query responds well to the 
google_search call and provide several snippets of websites which may provide context
for the query at hand about Victorian style homes.

Requests in prompt are only partially addressed
The query requests information for states on the east coast with a lot of victorian homes,
and also requests homes in at least two of those states in a certain price range. The response
addresses these by stating that it found some east coast states with victorian style homes.
After it says that it found homes from NY and Pennsylvania for over 600.000.
Therefore all requests are addressedd regardless of whether these statements are true.

output es response milyen kapcsolatban vannak, hallucinacio???

Many of the statements in this response are direct hallucinations and were not present in the tool output.
Of the states provided in the response, only New York was included somewhere in the search results.
In addition, none of the addressess in the result are in the tool output, they are completely hallucinated.

Tool Usage
Despite being the incorrect tool to use for houses, the tool output does contain at least one address on a website that suggests 
that house is of a victorian style. The response does not use this. In addition there is a lot of information which would be
helpful to the user in context of a well-executed punt, perhaps telling the user how they could look at houses and use
certain features to tell whether houses they were offered were of a victorian style or not. Regardless, there is information
provided in this tool output that is not used effectively in the response.

less conversational response
In this case the next surrounding the results is too direct. There is no checking in with the user over their request, or making
any statements besides the introduction of the results. This suggests that the result is not conversational, especially considering
the way the user's query is making a broad inquiry, rather than a very detailed and specific ask.

Overall task justification
This response fails to fulfill the user query in a lot of ways. Most importantly, it begins incorrectly by not calling one
of the tools for housing. This means that several other factors will automatically be wrong and the user will not get the third party
help they are looking for. Additionally importantly, regardless of results, the response hallucinates a lot.
A response with that many hallucinations can never be helpful, especially when information is specific in this way.
